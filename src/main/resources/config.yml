# MiniGameStatistic Configuration

# Plugin mode: "LOBBY" or "GAME"
# LOBBY mode: Listens for statistics from game servers, saves to database, and shows holograms
# GAME mode: Sends statistics to lobby server after game ends
mode: GAME

# Lobby server name (used in GAME mode to send statistics)
lobby-server: "Lobby-1"

# Proxy service name (used to execute send commands for player teleportation)
proxy-service: "Proxy-1"

# Delay in seconds before teleporting players back to lobby after game ends
teleport-delay: 5

# Game server name (used in GAME mode, auto-detected if "auto")
game-server-name: "auto"

# ===== Scoreboard Tracking (used in GAME mode) =====
# Reads vanilla Minecraft scoreboard objectives to automatically collect player stats.
# Use /savescoreboard after each round to snapshot data, then /gameend to send.
# If scoreboard is enabled, /gameend will auto-attach the data (no manual stats needed).
scoreboard:
  enabled: true
  # How to merge data across multiple rounds on the same server:
  #   SUM  - add values from each round together (e.g. total kills across all rounds)
  #   MAX  - keep the highest value from any single round (e.g. best score in any round)
  merge-mode: "SUM"
  # Which field to sort players by in hologram display (descending). Optional.
  # If not set, the first field in objectives is used.
  sort-by: "score"
  # Map each stat field to a vanilla scoreboard objective name.
  # You can add ANY number of fields here — they will all be tracked, saved, and displayed.
  # Set to "" or remove the line to skip that stat.
  # These objective names must match the ones your minigame plugin creates.
  # Example: if your game uses "/scoreboard objectives add game_kills dummy"
  objectives:
    kills: "game_kills"
    deaths: "game_deaths"
    assists: "game_assists"
    score: "game_score"
    # Add more fields as needed, for example:
    # damage: "game_damage"
    # heals: "game_heals"
    # blocks_placed: "game_blocks"

# ===== Database Configuration (used in LOBBY mode) =====
database:
  enabled: false
  # Supported types: postgresql (recommended), mysql, mariadb, mongodb
  type: "postgresql"
  host: "localhost"
  port: 5432
  database: "minigame_stats"
  username: "postgres"
  password: "password"

# ===== Hologram Configuration (used in LOBBY mode) =====
# Duration in seconds for the hologram to stay visible (0 = until next game)
hologram-duration: 30

# Multiple hologram locations (add as many as you need)

  - world: "world"
    x: 0.5
    y: 65.0
    z: 0.5

# Hologram display format - you can customize which lines appear
# Available placeholders:
#   Header/Footer: {game_name}, {winner}, {player_count}, {match_id}, {duration}
#   Per-player line: {player_name} and any field name from objectives wrapped in {}
#     e.g. {kills}, {deaths}, {assists}, {score}, {damage}, {heals}, etc.
